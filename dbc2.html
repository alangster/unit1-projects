				<span class="title"><h3>Introduction</h3></span>
				<ul>
					<li>House wren clutches may hatch asynchronously over several days, resulting in offspring that differ markedly in size shortly after hatching, or they may hatch synchronously within a day of one another, and as a result, siblings are similar in size.</li>
					<li>In asynchronous broods, unequal distribution of parental food resources often results in the death of the younger/smaller offspring.</li>
					<li>Variation in brood hatching patterns is correlated with the timing of female incubation, and may also be influenced by differences in eggshell porosity within and among clutches.</li>
					<li>Greater eggshell porosity enhances the exchange of metabolic gases and water between the developing embryo and surrounding environment, thus increasing the rate of development.</li>
					<li>We investigated whether differences in eggshell porosity among and within clutches influenced differences in brood hatching patterns.</li>
					<li><span class="prediction">If brood hatching patterns were influenced by eggshell porosity, then we predicted that there would be differences in porosity between early-incubated clutches and late-incubated clutches.</span></li>
					<li><span class="prediction">We also predicted greater variability in eggshell porosity across the laying order within asynchronous clutches when compared to the porosity of eggshells within synchronous clutches.</span></li>
				</ul>

				<span class="title"><h3>Methods</h3></span>
				<ul>
					<li>Eggs from 28 clutches were collected and measured (weight, length, and breadth) during the summers of 2012 and 2013 from nest boxes in a secondary deciduous forest in north-central Illinois (40°40’N, 88°53’W).</li>
					<li>We classified the onset of female incubation as “early” (before laying the penultimate egg) and “late” (on or after laying the penultimate egg) based on the relative temperature of the eggs at collection.</li>
					<li>We boiled eggshells in 5% NaOH to remove the eggshell membrane and cuticle, then washed them with DI water, and air dried.</li>
					<li>Using a Nikon E-600 compound microscope, we photographed each fragment (N = 2232 fragments from 112 eggs) with a Nikon MT-5B camera.</li>
					<li>The surface area of each fragment was calculated from each image using Image J (ver. 1.46r, NIH), and the eggshell thickness measured using a base-mounted thickness gauge.</li>
					<li>Pore number was recorded and pore diameter was measured at 40x magnification for the first, second, penultimate, and ultimate eggs.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div id="results">
			<span class="title"><h3>Results</h3></span>
				<ul>
					<li>We found significant variation in porosity among eggshells from different females, and a significant positive correlation between porosity and egg size.</li>
					<li>There was minimal within-clutch variation, and there was no association between an egg’s position in the laying sequence and estimated porosity.</li>
					<li>There was no significant difference in the porosity of eggs laid by females initiating early or late incubation.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<span class="title"><h3>Conclusions</h3></span>
				<ul>
					<li>Our data suggest that differences in brood hatching patterns are not explained by differences in porosity within or among clutches.</li>
					<li>Female onset of incubation is the primary determinant of variation in brood hatching patterns in the House Wren.</li>
					<li>At our study site, the breeding season progresses and resources become limiting, the frequency of asynchronously hatching clutches increases, perhaps to ensure the survivorship of at least some of the offspring.</li>
					<li>Therefore, limiting resources may influence the timing at which the female commences incubation.</li>
