<p>The Let'sRun.com homepage is essentially a collection of links to race results and articles about running. Without the site, it would be difficult for fans of track and field to find news, because track and field is such a fringe sport. There are devoted fans, but they are few and far between. Therefore, Let'sRun solves the problem of there being sparse mainstream coverage of track and field by pulling together the scattered coverage it does receive. However, because the site pulls together so many different bits of information, it faces the challenge of preventing it from appearing cluttered. Let'sRun was recently redesigned to have three columns, which has helped a bit with organization, but there is no set area for links of a certain type (e.g., there is no "Race Resuls" column or "Reccommended Reads" column). As aresult, it still appears cluttered. The cluttering issue is compounded by the advertising space that Let'sRun sells as its only source of revenue. The site's owners have to be careful to make the advertising prominent enough that potential advertisers will want to buy space, but subtle enough so as to not drive away users.</p>
