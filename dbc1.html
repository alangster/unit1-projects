			<p>I attended <a href="www.iwu.edu" target="_blank">Illinois Wesleyan University</a>, where I double majored in Biology and History--a strange combination, perhaps, but I enjoyed both. I feel that studying those subjects has made me a decent writer, researcher, and critical thinker, but I obviously <strong>never</strong> learned any sort of coding.</p>

			<h5>Interests</h5>
			<p>Sports have always been a big part of my life. Growing up I played baseball, soccer, and basketball pretty much year-round. In high school, I caught the running bug and competed in cross country and track into college until stress fractures derailed my running career. Despite no longer running, I spend an inordinate amount of time on <a href="ww.letsrun.com">Let's Run</a>. Even with the time spent playing sports I found time to read and develop an appreciation of many types of music, with my favorite artists including the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Vampire Weekend</li>
				<li>Chance the Rapper</li>
				<li>Bob Dylan</li>
				<li>The Black Keys</li>
				<li>Andrew Bird</li>
				<li>Freelance Whales</li>
				<li>The Tallest Man on Earth</li>
				<li>Kanye West</li>
				<li>Kendrick Lamar</li>
				<li>The National</li>
			</ol>
			<p>I also <em>love</em> to travel. I have been all over the US, but I have not done as much international travel as I would like. So far, I have been to the following countries (other than the US):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>New Zealand</li>
				<li>Australia</li>
				<li>Sweden</li>
				<li>Denmark</li>
			</ul>
